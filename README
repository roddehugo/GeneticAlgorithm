This program solves, or rather finds a good solution for the TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem).

Once you've domwloaded and installed Oracle Sun JRE, run the jar file.

Choose the number of cities : (ex : 30)
Choose the number of ways : (ex : 120, the more you have ways the luckier you should be)
Choose the number of iterations (i.e : generations) : (ex : 1000, a big number is necessary)
Choose the number of mutations : choose between 2 or 3 and you'll get good results)

You can also either save the generated cities in a file or re-use the previous saved cities.

Then launch the program !
